# "Shooter of the Year" Dashboard

This project is an R Shiny dashboard illustrating the [Performance Method](http://archerytoolkit/soty/article.html) calculations for a variety of USA Archery and NFAA archery rounds. These calculations provide a means for an archery club or organization to rank their participants and calculate a "shooter of the year." The Performance Method works across disciplines and represents an improvement over some of the more commonly used approaches.
